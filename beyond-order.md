## Chapters (Rules)

### 1. Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievements.

#### Loneliness and confussion.

People depend on constant communication with others to keep their minds organised. We think to keep things straight, but we mostly think by talking. When talking with others about the past we distinguish trivial and overblown concerns from truly important things. We talk to remember and forget.

#### Sanity as a social institution.

When assessing patience, before asking abou the person itself, he asks about the social world surrounding them: have you been educated? Is your use of free time satisfactory? Do you have plans for the future? Do you have a good job, friends, family and/or partner? If some of these things are missing, the person is not well embedded in the social world. We exists not as individuals but as people living among people. **People remain sane** not because of their own minds but **because other people remind them how to think, act and speak.**

#### The point of pointing. 

Babies point their fingers to see how adults react to them pointing at stuff. By pointing, they can assess how important that thing is for the rest of the people and more importantly, validate yourself as a respected member deserving attention. Talking is exactly like pointing but more precise and flexible. If you fail to talk about something remarkable, you risk your social value falling to zero. 

#### What should we point to?
